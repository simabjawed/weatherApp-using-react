# What is it?

This package provides a simple RPC mechanism on top of any transport that transfers
JSON data. It was initially conceived to provide communication with web workers
(and as such supports transferables), but it can be used on top of many other
different transport channels, i.e. `postMessage` between frames, websockets via
`socket.io` or JSON encoded messages over pipes.

# How to use it?

## Installation

You can install the library into your project via npm

    npm install worker-rpc

The library is written in Typescript and will work in any environment that
supports ES5 and ES6-style promises (either native or through a shim).
No external typings are required for using this library with Typescript (version >= 2).

## Web worker example

In this example, we use the library to set up communication with a web worker.

### Web worker

    import {RpcProvider} from 'worker-rpc';

    const rpcProvider = new RpcProvider(
        (message, transfer) => postMessage(message, transfer)
    );

    onmessage = e => rpcProvider.dispatch(e.data);

    rpcProvider.registerRpcHandler('add', ({x, y}) => x + y);

The RPC provider is initialized with a function that dispatches a message.
This function will receive an opaque message object as first argument, and
a list of transferables as second argument. This allows to leverage transfer
of ownership instead of copying between worker and host page.

On incoming messages, `dispatch` is called on the RPC provider in order to
handle the message.

Each registered RPC handler is identified by a message ID (`add` in this example)
and has a handler function that receives the message object and can return a
result either as an immediate value or as a promise. 

### Page

    import {RpcProvider} from 'worker-rpc';

    const worker = new Worker('worker.js'),
        rpcProvider = new RpcProvider(
            (message, transfer) => worker.postMessage(message, transfer)
        );
    
    worker.onmessage = e => rpcProvider.dispatch(e.data);

    rpcProvider
        .rpc('add', {x: 1, y: 2})
        .then(result => console.log(result)); // 3

## Importing

ES5 / CommonJS

    var RpcProvider = require('worker-rpc').RpcProvider;

ES6

    import {RpcProvider} from 'worker-rpc';

Typescript

    import {RpcProvider, RpcProviderInterface} from 'worker-rpc';

##  API

The API is built around the `RpcProvider` class. A `RpcProvider` acts both as
client and server for RPC calls and event-like signals. The library uses ES6
promises and can consume any A+ compliant promises.

### Creating a new provider

    const rpc = new RpcProvider(dispatcher, timeout);

 * `dispatcher`: A function that will be called for dispatching messages. The
    first argument will be an opaque message object, and the second argument
    an error of `Transferable` objects that are to be passed via ownership
    transfer (if supported by the transport).
 * `timeout` (optional): The timeout for RPC transactions in mill
